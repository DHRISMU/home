	<h2>What is DHRI?</h2>
	<p>The Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) was a ten-day residential workshop held in June 2018 at The Graduate Center, CUNY. During the DHRI, which is supported by an <a href="https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/institutes/digital-humanities-research-institute-expanding-communities-practice">National Endowment for the Humanities Institutes in Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities grant</a>, participants explored interdisciplinary, digital humanities research and teaching with leading DH scholars, developed core computational research skills through hands-on workshops, and began work on developing versions of the DHRI for their own communities . 
		</p>
	<h2>The DHRI Philosophy</h2>

	<p>Short courses—or “bootcamps”—that last anywhere from one day to two months are an increasingly popular way to offer intensive training in digital tools and skills over a short period of time; however, these courses are resource-intensive to run, reach a limited audience, and rarely offer ongoing support.</p>
	<p> We believe that all participants are experts in something, but none are experts in all areas. By fostering a collaborative, interdisciplinary environment where humanities research questions, methods, and values are most significant, we work to build a cooperative learning experience. .. we have established an approach that leverages participant’s strengths, disciplinary interests, and research interests. Students work at round tables to encourage social interaction, conversation, and collaboration, and significant time is spent addressing questions about the appropriateness and consequences of digital methods, ethical concerns, project proposal development,and presentation of digital scholarship to multiple audiences.</p>
	<p><i>DHRI emphasizes foundational skills because we believe that it is the most effective path toward enabling digital humanities researchers to become self-teachers and mentors in their own right. Many bootcamp-style intensives prioritize instrumental outcomes, such as whether students can “write a for loop” or create a website. While these results are desirable, we find that students who know how to use the command line, read technical documentation, and reason about systems are more self-sufficient and better prepared to approach technology (and technical rhetoric) with a critical eye. This leads to second-and third-order effects as students teach themselves and teach others, and also provides a common conceptual vocabulary and skill set that serves as a basis for forming strong collaborations in the future.</i> </p>

	<h2>What is DHRI @ SMU?</h2>
	<p>The Digital Humanities Research Institute at SMU is being led by <a href="https://github.com/librarianrafia">Rafia Mirza</a>, a Humanities Liason at SMU Fondren Library. We are in the process of planning our version of DHRI based on  <a href="http://dhinstitutes.org/">CUNY's version</a> for summer 2019. If you are interested in working on it, please contact her at <a href="mailto:rmirza@smu.edu">rmirza@smu.edu</a>.</p>
<p> If you are inetrested in getting involved in the planning process, we are holding an open forum in Fondren Library, Texana Room on September 26th from 11:00-2:00 pm. </p>
