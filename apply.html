      <p>2019 will be the inaugural year of DHRI @ SMU! Our initial effort focuses on building capacity for the digital humanities in our community. We seek participants from a diverse cross-section of academe, to ensure both interdisciplinarity and inter-institutional representation. However, our limited number of available spots will make selection competitive.</p>
      <p>The application includes an essay section. You will write a few paragraphs (maximum) in response to each the following prompts. Share information about your goals, interests, and needs.</p>
          
      <ul>
          <li>Describe your research interests. Help us understand what type of digital projects might appeal to you.</li>
          <li>How will participating in DHRI benefit you personally, professionally, or pedagogically?</li>
          <li> Give an example of a technical issue you've experienced, and how you handled this problem. </li>
          <li>Provide examples of how you work collaboratively:  What roles do you naturally assume when working in a group? What roles have you taken on to ensure success of a project? How would you describe your contribution to the group dynamics? </li>
          </ul>

        
      <p>Participants must commit to the full 4-day experience, including attending all workshops and events. <b><a class="text-blue" href ="https://smu.az1.qualtrics.com">Submitting an application [link text] </a> indicates acknowledgement of this expectation.</b></p>
