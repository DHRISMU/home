      <p> DHRI @ SMU is based on the DHRI as developed at Graduate Center Digital Initiatives at The Graduate Center, CUNY.  <h2 class="text-blue"><a class="text-blue" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.html %}">Read more about our philosophy here.</a></h2><br> </p> 
      <p> DHRI participants are expected to commit to the full 4 ­day experience from August 19-­22, 2019 and to attend all of the workshops and events during this time.  By submitting an application to DHRI, participants acknowledge and accept the above expectations.</p>
      <p>As this is a pilot program focused on building capacity as a community, we  will have limited seats. (We expect the majority of particpants to be part of the SMU community, but do have a limited number of seats for participants outside of SMU).</p>
      <p>The application contains sections designed to help us get a better sense of the kind of digital projects you might be interested in working on. You will have to answer the following questions:</p>
      <p>* Please share information about your goals, interests, and needs.</p>
      <p>*Please describe your research  interests.</p>
      <p>*How will your participation in DHRI benefit your personal research and professional or pedagogical  goals?</p>
      <p>*Describe an instance when you ran into a technical problem that you didn't know the answer to right away. How did you overcome it?</p>
      <p>*What type of role do you feel most comfortable taking on when working in a group? Describe a time you worked on a group project; what role did you take on and how would you describe your contribution to the group?</p>
